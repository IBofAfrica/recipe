            Brief Intro to Nigerian Fried Rice</h2>
        <p>Nigerian Fried Rice is a very simple yet delicious recipe. This version relies on a ton of 
        fresh vegetables, Beef Liver, and a little bit of oil for crisping it up. <br>

        </p>
        
        <p>
            The added beef liver gives the fried Rice a very nice rich but subtle taste, and this is 
            why it is one of the most popular choices in Nigeria. Though you can also use Shrimp or any 
             protein you'd like.  If you would love to make vegan fried rice, you can omit the Beef liver <br>
             or Shrimps entirely!<br>

        </p>
        <p>
            This fried rice is entirely different from the popular <mark><u>Asian Chicken Fried Rice</u></mark> because the 
            depth of the taste in the latter comes from the Soy sauce while the depth of taste of the 
            latter comes from the <strong>Curry powder, Thyme, Seasoning cubes</strong>, and of course 
            the abundance of vegetables like Carrots, Green beans, Peas, sweet corn, and Onions. 
        </p>
        <p>Just like  Jollof Rice we savor these meals so much, and we can barely do without them in
            gatherings and festive seasons, and it's a meal you can make in no time. Such a simple
             recipe, but the impact it makes in a gathering is quite remarkable!

            This recipe starts with already parboiled rice, so it makes the whole process easier. If you 
            don't have already parboiled rice, you can see how to do that here. It's also okay to use a 
            day old rice that has been refrigerated it is very convenient, and the result is just as good.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also cooked this parboiled rice in a bit of well-seasoned stock so that the Rice can absorb 
             more flavor. Though it's advisable to do this, however, this step can be skipped if you are in 
             a hurry.

        <h2>Fresh Rice or Leftover Rice?</h2>
        <p>
            You can use either freshly cooked rice (parboiled) or leftover cold rice for this recipe. If you 
            choose to use <em>freshly cooked rice</em>, make sure you choose the right type of Rice. I like to 
            use the <em>long grain parboiled rice</em>. This type of Rice is very easy to work with when making 
            Fried Rice likewise, Jollof Rice because it's firmer and less sticky, therefore, making it very 
            difficult to go wrong when working with it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another key to achieving a good result when making this fried rice is to allow the freshly 
            cooked rice (parboiled) to cool slightly before using it. The rice should be cool to the 
            touch before adding it to the pan. If you are short of time, simply spread the rice on a 
            sheet pan so that the steam can easily escape or just place the cooked rice inside the fridge 
            for a few minutes.
        </p>
        <p>Finally, it is important that you always wash the rice before cooking it. This will help to 
            remove the excess starch on the rice, which can cause the rice to clump together.

            <h3>Notes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The white rice should be cooked tender but still firm to bite (like you cook your pasta al-dente). Overcooking the rice will result in mushy fried rice.</li>
                <li>Fried rice is best enjoyed when the Veggies remain crunchy, so don’t overcook your veggies.</li>
                <li>You need to increase the heat and stir continuously to get that nice coveted crisp during frying.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
